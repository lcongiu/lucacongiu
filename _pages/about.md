What I do
--------
My research is in Behavioral and Experimental Economics, and focuses on the design of choice architecture. Specifically, I study framing effects stemming from verbal vs. non-verbal aspects of the choice context and explore their implications for decision theory and public policies (nudges). I mainly conduct lab and online experiments, and I program them with oTree.
